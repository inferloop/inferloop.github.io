Inferloop is an early-stage startup that is involved in research and development (R&D) of machine learning, sensors and signal processing techniques in an effort to help improve effectiveness and efficiency of the healthcare system.

Our **mission** is to make sense of and draw insights from data to drive effective and efficient decisions. 

### Who we are
The team collectively has several decades of experience R&D and innovating at the cutting-edge in healthcare and several technology driven industries. We have PhD and Masters degrees from places like UCLA and USC, worked at successful start-ups, research organizations, the biggest tech companies and top management consulting firms.

### Research Areas
In order to achieve our mission, we need to be at the cutting-edge of research in several areas of machine learning applied to healthcare. We would like to bridge the latest science of disease pathways in biology with the best techniques in machine learning. Here is a representative list of areas we are pursuing 

1. **Deep learning** models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in several problem domains like computer vision, speech recognition, text understanding, etc. A natural question to ask is can we apply state-of-the-art deep learning models like ConvNets, LSTMs and others to health data? Health data and healthcare space comes with its own set of challenges:
    - *Robustness*: How can we build models that are robust to corrupted or strange data? 
    - *Reliability*: When the model makes predictions can it be aware of its own limitations and signal when it is not very confident of its predictions? Can we detect if the model is poorly-calibrated?
    - *Interpretability*: Models deployed in healthcare need to be understood, validated, edited, and trusted. Deep learning models have the notorious reputation of being opaque, black-box models providing very little insight on how and why they work

2. Machine learning models incorporating **continuous monitoring** data
    - Critical care and wearable health sensors are sources of streaming data that can be used to gauge patient state accurately in order to make decisions about effective interventions
    - Reinforcement learning is a framework that is used to find the best action in a given state, can we apply ideas from this field to find out which treatments worked well in a particular situation?
    - The research challenge is how to build models to handle these large amounts of data, potentially of variable quality providing a continuous assessment of patient state of health 



3. Extracting useful information from **unstructured data**
    - How can the text data (clinical notes) be used to improve model accuracy? 
    - How can image data (scans) be used?
    - How can all of this be done with added constraints of Security and Privacy?

4. **Personalization** of medical treatments
    - Recommendation engines have been used successfully for personalized recommendation of videos, articles, etc. Can we apply similar technology to medical treatments?
